 - Drag the "display" window on to the secondary display, and have it enter full screen mode.  (The easiest way to do this is to press [Command + Control + F])
 - Ensure that the "display" window is rendering correctly on the AV equiptment, and address and "chroma key" or "cropping" which needs to be addressed.
 - Make the "primary" window on the computer enter full screen as well.  
 - Run through the Pre-Ceremony Checklist

### Pre-Ceremony Checklist
 - Make sure the computer is plugged in and is charging.  Note: the little battery icon in the top right corner should have a "lightning bolt" on it indicating that the battery is actively charging.  
 - Double check the power cord to make sure that it is fully plugged in, and is not likely to fall out during the Ceremony
 - Ensure that the History CSV file (for the previous ceremony as is relevant) has been stored somewhere secure.
 - Make sure the hardware scanner is working properly by scanning a few QR Codes (ideally actual cards/codes for the upcoming ceremony)
 - Make sure that the backup camera scanner is working properly by scanning a few QR Codes
 - Make sure that the "primary" and "display" windows are talking to eachother correctly by advancing the queue onto the "display" window a couple times.
 - Make sure that the "display" window is being properly projected onto the **big screen**
 - Confirm that the keyboard (or any other) input methods are working correctly, and that all "hot keys" are working to advance the queue.  (Right Arrow, Enter, Back Arrow, Escape)
 - Reset the Queue History

### Post-Ceremony Checklist
